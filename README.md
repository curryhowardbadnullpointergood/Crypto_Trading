# SolAlpha AI Trading Bot - LLM Powered Crypto Trading on Solana


**Intelligent Crypto Trading, Powered by AI.**

SolAlpha AI is a cutting-edge trading bot designed to navigate the complexities of the Solana cryptocurrency market. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced statistical analysis, this bot aims to provide data-driven trading decisions with a focus on risk assessment and efficiency.

**Key Features:**

*   **LLM-Driven Trading Signals:**  Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze market sentiment, news, and technical indicators to generate intelligent trading signals.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Employs robust statistical methods to identify market trends, patterns, and potential trading opportunities.
*   **Risk Assessment Engine:** Integrates a sophisticated risk assessment module to evaluate potential trades and manage capital effectively.
*   **Efficient Solana Trading:** Optimized for the Solana blockchain, enabling fast and low-cost trading on Solana Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).
*   **User-Friendly Frontend:**  Interactive web-based frontend for easy monitoring, configuration, and performance analysis.
*   **Python Backend:**  Built with Python for robust AI logic, API integrations, and data processing.
*   **OpenAI API Integration:**  Leverages the OpenAI API (or similar LLM APIs) for advanced natural language processing and market understanding.

**Getting Started:**

Follow these steps to get your SolAlpha AI Trading Bot up and running:

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Python 3.x:** Python 3.x is required for the backend components.
*   **OpenAI API Key (or alternative LLM API Key):** You will need an API key from OpenAI (or your chosen LLM provider) to enable the AI-powered features.  Set this as an environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
*   **Solana RPC URL:**  You'll need a Solana RPC URL to interact with the Solana blockchain. You can use public providers or set up your own. Set this as an environment variable (e.g., `SOLANA_RPC_URL`).
*   **[Optional] Jupiter API Key (or DEX API Key):** If your bot interacts directly with DEX APIs, you might need API keys for those services.

**Installation and Setup:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Navigate back to the Root Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

5.  **[If Backend is separate - Adjust if needed] Install Backend Dependencies (using pip - Python package installer):**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
    # OR
    # pip install -e .             # If you have a setup.py file for backend
    ```
    *Adjust these Python installation commands based on how your backend dependencies are managed.*

6.  **Set Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or frontend and backend directories if separated) and add your API keys and RPC URLs:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    SOLANA_RPC_URL=your_solana_rpc_url_here
    # JUPITER_API_KEY=your_jupiter_api_key_here (if needed)
    # ... other environment variables ...
    ```
    *Replace `your_openai_api_key_here`, `your_solana_rpc_url_here`, etc., with your actual API keys and URLs.*

7.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the frontend development server.  Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

8.  **[If Backend is separate - Adjust if needed] Run the Backend Server (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    cd backend  # Navigate to backend directory
    python main.py  # Or your backend startup script (e.g., python app.py)
    ```
    *Adjust the backend startup command based on your backend structure.*

**Usage:**

1.  **Access the Frontend:** Open your web browser and go to the address where the frontend development server is running (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  **Explore the Dashboard:** The frontend dashboard provides an overview of market data, trading signals generated by the AI, risk assessments, and bot performance.
3.  **Configure Trading Settings:**  Navigate to the settings panel to configure:
    *   **Trading Pairs:** Select the Solana tokens you want the bot to monitor and trade.
    *   **Risk Parameters:** Adjust risk tolerance levels, position sizing, and other risk management settings.
    *   **AI Strategy Settings:** [If applicable] Configure parameters for the LLM-based AI strategy.
    *   **API Keys & Connections:** [If needed]  Ensure your API keys and Solana RPC connections are correctly configured.
4.  **Monitor Trading Activity:**  Observe the bot's trading activity, performance metrics, and generated signals in real-time through the dashboard.
5.  **[Dry Run Mode Recommended Initially]:**  Start with dry-run or simulation mode to test the bot's strategies and configurations without risking real capital.
